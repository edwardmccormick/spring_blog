<h1>Hi there, my name is Ted.</h1>

<h4>I turn coffee and breakfast tacos into beautiful, interactive, responsive websites.</h4>
<p>I'm a former Navy officer with engineering leadership experience, strong communication skills,
    and a diverse technical background transitioning into software development.
    Iâ€™m passionate about implementing technically-challenging, value-added projects
    while continuing to add new skills and grow mastery with my current skill set.</p>
